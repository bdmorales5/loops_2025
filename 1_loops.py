# Example Practice:
# Given this list of fruits:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# Challenge:
# Use a for loop to print each fruit on a new line.
print(len(fruits))
print(fruits[0])
print(fruits[1])
print(fruits[2])
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# # i just worked with loops

# Given a list of school subjects:
subjects = ["Math", "Science", "History", "Art"]
for subject in subjects:
    print(subject)
Challenge:
# Use a for loop and range to print each subject along with its index:
# Example output: "Subject 0: Math"
for subject in subject:
    if subject == "history":
        break
    print(subject)
    for subject in subject :
        if subject == "science":
            continue
        print(subject)

list1000 = list(range(1,1001))
# break when you reach a number greather than 599
for number in list1000:
    if number > 599:
        break 
    print(number)

for number in list1000:
    if number > 500:
        break
    print(number)











# Given:
# numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]

# # Challenge:
# Use a for loop to add all the numbers and print the total.
